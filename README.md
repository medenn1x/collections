most of the documentation is heavily derived from Oracle API documentation. The whole

## Prerelease content warning
Many classes and interfaces herein are in an experimental, pre-release state and may
not be relied upon to remain consistent in future version. Expect breaking changes.
In particular, any class or interface in the net.arinoru.prerelease package or tagged
with the @net.arinoru.prerelease.PrereleaseContent annotation should be considered
unsafe for use in any scenario where maintaining compatibility between versions is
necessary.
